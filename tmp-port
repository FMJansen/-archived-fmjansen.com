        <h3>Andromache</h3>
        <p>For the play called Andromache (an Old-Greek story, which features elements of the Trojan war) which was performed at my school, I made the logo, some posters and a booklet.</p>

        <h3>Mail-experiment</h3>
        <p>I wanted to try some CSS3-effects, so I made this. It's far from user-friendly, but hey, it folds. Chrome (or Safari) renders it better than other browsers.</p>

        <h3>Columnt</h3>
        <p>I'm trying to build a Twitter-client, but until now nothing but the design is finished. It would have multiple columns, an always-present but unobtrusive compose-field and keyboard-navigation.</p>

        <h3>English literature</h3>
        <p>For another assignment at school we had to tell something about a part of the english literature, using a timeline. My part had to be about The Miller's Tale and I made this timeline. You can see it <a href="/englishlit/">live</a>.</p>
